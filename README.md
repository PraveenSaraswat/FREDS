# FREDS
Face Recognition and Emotion Detection

Face Recognition and Emotion Detection System(FREDS) is based on DLIB api for face recognition in python. It uses CK (Cohn Kanade) dataset for Emotion detection and uses curated database and google acquired images for training and testing.

This project , when image supplied, detects the face, identifies the encoding and predicts it using SVC on already trained dataset. Instantly it identifies the emotion associated with the image for which face recogntion is done.

This is for learning and personal use. Following links are used for learning and training the dataset. https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/wiki/Face-Recognition-Accuracy-Problems https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/blob/master/examples/face_recognition_knn.py https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-multiple-face-recognition-using-dlib/ https://www.researchgate.net/post/How_do_I_determine_the_accuracy_of_Face_Recognition
Big shout out to github.com/ageitgey This code is inspired from his work and takes cues from it. We tried developing this as one shot and also on the basis of trained classifiers.

this is still work in progress and periodic updates will be made.
